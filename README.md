Fast-paced 2D Action Platformer

Overview

Red Dash is a solo-developed 2D action platformer that challenges players with fast-paced movement, responsive combat, and progressively difficult levels. Players must dash, jump, and attack through dynamic environments filled with enemies and hazards.

The game emphasizes precision, reflexes, and strategic upgrades, providing a rewarding arcade-like experience. Each level introduces new obstacles and enemy patterns, keeping gameplay fresh and engaging.

Red Dash was developed from concept to polish entirely by a solo indie developer, including gameplay design, programming, visual assets, and UI/UX.

Gameplay

Players control a nimble hero navigating levels filled with enemies and traps. The core gameplay loop involves:

Movement & Combat – Dash and jump to avoid hazards while attacking enemies.

Progression – Collect resources to upgrade abilities, unlocking new ways to traverse and combat.

Challenge Scaling – Levels become progressively harder, with smarter enemy behaviors and more complex obstacles.

Key Mechanics:

Fast, responsive player controls for precise movement

Charging attacks or dashes to strategize in combat

Procedurally inspired challenges for replayability
